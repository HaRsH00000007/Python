#Difference between a tuple and a list:
#The major key difference is that
# "Tuples" are "Immutable" means 
# Tuples cannot be changed
# But
# "Lists" are "Mutable" means
# Lists can be changed



#Creating a tuple using()
t=(1,5,7,8)
print(t)


#Printing elements of a tuple
print(t[3])


#t1=() ---> # Empty tuple
#t1=(1) ---> # Wrong way to declare tuple with single element
t1=(1,) #---> # Correct way to declare tuple with single element
print(t1)
